# citadel_defence
Citadel Defence is a simple game like famous Tower Defence. The difference is that you can control your units.
To place a new unit (one of three types), you need to earn coins by killing enemies. You can give orders to your troops to move and to attack certain enemies with right mouse button. All you have to do is defend your citadel for some period of time.
Have fun)
